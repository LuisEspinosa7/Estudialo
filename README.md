# Estudialo.co backend - Vocational guidance app as well as educational offers. BACKEND

Estudialo.co WAS the backend for the web and mobile app (android and iOS) which WAS created as a vocational guidance app as well as
educational offers plartform, this is to say everyone could take a simple test, and the app was able to classify that person's potential
based on the phycological theory of the MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES, and just after the results, the available educational offer was
showed to the user. 
NOTE: IT IS A PITY THAT THE APP IS NOT AVAILABLE TODAY, SINCE IT WAS CONCEIVE AS A BUSINESS NO AS A HELP FOR PEOPLE.
It was developed by Luis Espinosa Llanos and for the backend it was used the following technologies and tools: 

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Core	
    </td>
    <td>
  	Java 1.8, Spring Boot 2 (Spring Framework), Data JPA, Hibernate, Loombok, Jackson Databinding
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Server	
    </td>
    <td>
  	Apache Tomcat Embebido (Spring Boot)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Executable	
    </td>
    <td>
  	Jar
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It was written using the best practices for instance, a controller, service and repository layer approach, code reusing, unit tests, 
a good condition coverage, dependecy injection, design patterns and more... 

## Where is the FrontEnd?
Since I don't really developed the frontend at that moment, I feel IT IS UNETHICAL to publish that code as mine. 
So in this case, it has no Web FrontEnd or Mobile app code.


## Development Resources
I provide the following resources:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Database SQL Backup	
    </td>
    <td>
	In the db folder
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Postman Collection	
    </td>
    <td>
	In the postman folder
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
